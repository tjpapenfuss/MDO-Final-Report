%%%%%%%%%  ABSTRACT  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
This paper is an example of using {\upshape\texttt{asmeconf}} with {\upshape\hologo{LuaLaTeX}} to solve an ODE initial value problem using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and to plot the result using {\upshape\texttt{PGFPLOTS}}. The use of a landscape figure is also illustrated. References are given for further reading.

%%%%%%%%%  BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\hologo{LuaLaTeX} is built upon the Lua programming language~\cite{lua}. By directly using Lua code in a \LaTeX\ file, we can accomplish a wide range of tasks, as illustrated in the open-access paper by Montijano et al.~\cite{montijano2014}.  In the present example, we follow Montijano et al.\ in solving a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation and plotting the result---all within a single \LaTeX\ file!

\section{Solution to an initial value problem}
We consider an initial value problem like that of Montijano et al.:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:1}
y'(t) = A\cdot y(t) \cos\Big(t + \sqrt{1 + y(t)}\,\Big) \text{ with }y(0)=1
\end{equation}
Here, $A$ is a constant. We may adopt a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for the integration, which we shall perform to $t = 30$~s using a 400 point discretization.  The details of the Runge-Kutta algorithm and a listing of the code are given in Montijano et al. (You can also read the code in the present \texttt{.tex} file.)

The algorithm is implemented directly in the preamble of this file, and the results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:1} for $A = \{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\}$. Plotting is done using the \texttt{PGFPLOTS} package~\cite{pgfplots}.

Landscape figures may be produced at full-page size by putting \verb|\usepackage[figuresright]{rotating}| (Fig.~\ref{fig:1}) into your \texttt{.tex} file's preamble and using the \texttt{sidewaysfigure*} environment~\cite{fairbairns}.

%%%  CONCLUSIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Conclusion}
\hologo{LuaLaTeX} enables numerical computations within a \LaTeX\ environment. By combining this capability with
\texttt{PGFPlots}, the need for separate numerical and/or graphics packages can be reduced.
